# Server Routes

> Nitro supports filesystem routing to automatically map files to h3 routes.

## Event handlers

An [event handler](https://h3.dev/guide/event-handler) is a function that will be bound to a route and executed when the route is matched by the router for an incoming request.

:read-more{to="https://h3.dev/guide/event-handler"}

## Filesystem routing

Nitro supports file-based routing for your API routes (files are automatically mapped to [h3 routes](https://h3.dev/guide/router)). Defining a route is as simple as creating a file inside the `server/api/` or `server/routes/` directory.

You can only define one handler per files and you can [append the HTTP method](#specific-request-method) to the filename to define a specific request method.

```md
server/
  api/
    test.ts      <-- /api/test
  routes/
    hello.get.ts     <-- GET /hello
    hello.post.ts    <-- POST /hello
nitro.config.ts
```

You can nest routes by creating subdirectories.

```md
server/
  routes/
    communities/
      index.get.ts
      index.post.ts
      [id]/
        index.get.ts
        index.post.ts
    hello.get.ts
    hello.post.ts
```

::tip
Some providers like Vercel use a top-level `/api/` directory as a feature, therefore routes placed in `/api` won't work.
You will have to use `server/routes/api/`.
::

### Simple routes

First, create a file in `server/routes/` or `server/api/` directory. The filename will be the route path.

Then, export a function wrapped in `defineEventHandler` that will be executed when the route is matched.

```ts [server/api/test.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(() => {
  return { hello: 'API' }
})
```

### Route with params

#### Single param

To define a route with params, use the `[<param>]` syntax where `<param>` is the name of the param. The param will be available in the `event.context.params` object or using the `getRouterParam` utility from [h3](https://h3.dev/).

```ts [server/routes/hello/[name\\].ts]
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  const name = getRouterParam(event, 'name')

  return `Hello ${name}!`
})
```

Call the route with the param `/hello/nitro`, you will get:

```txt [Response]
Hello nitro!
```

#### Multiple params

You can define multiple params in a route using `[<param1>]/[<param2>]` syntax where each param is a folder. You **cannot** define multiple params in a single filename of folder.

```ts [server/routes/hello/[name\\]/[age\\].ts]
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  const name = getRouterParam(event, 'name')
  const age = getRouterParam(event, 'age')

  return `Hello ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`
})
```

#### Catch all params

You can capture all the remaining parts of a URL using `[...<param>]` syntax. This will include the `/` in the param.

```ts [server/routes/hello/[...name\\].ts]
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  const name = getRouterParam(event, 'name')

  return `Hello ${name}!`
})
```

Call the route with the param `/hello/nitro/is/hot`, you will get:

```txt [Response]
Hello nitro/is/hot!
```

### Specific request method

You can append the HTTP method to the filename to force the route to be matched only for a specific HTTP request method, for example `hello.get.ts` will only match for `GET` requests. You can use any HTTP method you want.

::code-group
```js [GET]
// server/routes/users/[id].get.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const id = getRouterParam(event, 'id')

  // Do something with id

  return `User profile!`
})
```

```js [POST]
// server/routes/users.post.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async event => {
  const body = await readBody(event)

  // Do something with body like saving it to a database

  return { updated: true }
})
```
::

### Catch all route

You can create a special route that will match all routes that are not matched by any other route. This is useful for creating a default route.

To create a catch all route, create a file named `[...].ts` in the `server/routes/` or `server/api/` directory or in any subdirectory.

```ts [server/routes/[...\\].ts]
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  const url = getRequestURL(event)

  return `Hello ${url}!`
})
```

### Environment specific handlers

You can specify for a route that will only be included in specific builds by adding a `.dev`, `.prod` or `.prerender` suffix to the file name, for example: `routes/test.get.dev.ts` or `routes/test.get.prod.ts`.

> [!TIP]
> You can specify multiple environments or specify a preset name as environment using programmatic registration of routes via `handlers[]` config.


## Middleware

Nitro route middleware can hook into the request lifecycle.

::tip
A middleware can modify the request before it is processed, not after.
::

:read-more{to="https://h3.dev/guide/event-handler#middleware"}

Middleware are auto-registered within the `server/middleware/` directory.

```md
server/
  routes/
    hello.ts
  middleware/
    auth.ts
    logger.ts
    ...
nitro.config.ts
```

### Simple middleware

Middleware are defined exactly like route handlers with the only exception that they should not return anything.
Returning from middleware behaves like returning from a request - the value will be returned as a response and further code will not be ran.

```ts [server/middleware/auth.ts]
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  // Extends or modify the event
  event.context.user = { name: 'Nitro' }
})
```

Middleware in `server/middleware/` directory are automatically registered for all routes. If you want to register a middleware for a specific route, see [Object Syntax Event Handler](https://h3.dev/guide/event-handler#object-syntax).

::note
Returning anything from a middleware will close the request and should be avoided! Any returned value from middleware will be the response and further code will not be executed however **this is not recommended to do!**
::

### Route Meta

You can define route handler meta at build-time using `defineRouteMeta` macro in the event handler files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸš§ This feature is currently experimental.

```ts [server/api/test.ts]
defineRouteMeta({
  openAPI: {
    tags: ["test"],
    description: "Test route description",
    parameters: [{ in: "query", name: "test", required: true }],
  },
});

export default defineEventHandler(() => "OK");
```

::read-more{to="https://swagger.io/specification/v3/"}
This feature is currently usable to specify OpenAPI meta. See swagger specification for available OpenAPI options.
::

### Execution order

Middleware are executed in directory listing order.

```md
server/
  middleware/
    auth.ts <-- First
    logger.ts <-- Second
    ... <-- Third
```

Prefix middleware with a number to control their execution order.

```md
server/
  middleware/
    1.logger.ts <-- First
    2.auth.ts <-- Second
    3.... <-- Third
```
::note
Remember that file names are sorted as strings, thus for example if you have 3 files `1.filename.ts`, `2.filename.ts` and `10.filename.ts`, the `10.filename.ts` will come after the `1.filename.ts`. To avoid this, prefix `1-9` with a `0` like `01`, if you have more than 10 middleware in the same directory.
::

### Request filtering

Middleware are executed on every request.

Apply custom logic to scope them to specific conditions.

For example, you can use the URL to apply a middleware to a specific route:

```ts [server/middleware/auth.ts]
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  // Will only execute for /auth route
  if (getRequestURL(event).pathname.startsWith('/auth')) {
    event.context.user = { name: 'Nitro' }
  }
})
```

## Error handling

You can use the [utilities available in H3](https://h3.dev/guide/event-handler#error-handling) to handle errors in both routes and middlewares.

The way errors are sent back to the client depends on the route's path. For most routes `Content-Type` is set to `text/html` by default and a simple html error page is delivered. If the route starts with `/api/` (either because it is placed in `api/` or `routes/api/`) the default will change to `application/json` and a JSON object will be sent.

This behaviour can be overridden by some request properties (e.g.: `Accept` or `User-Agent` headers).

## Route Rules

Nitro allows you to add logic at the top-level for each route of your configuration. It can be used for redirecting, proxying, caching and adding headers to routes.

It is a map from route pattern (following [rou3](https://github.com/h3js/rou3)) to route options.

When `cache` option is set, handlers matching pattern will be automatically wrapped with `defineCachedEventHandler`. See the [cache guide](/guide/cache) to learn more about this function.

::note
`swr: true|number` is shortcut for `cache: { swr: true, maxAge: number }`
::

You can set route rules in `nitro.config.ts` using the `routeRules` option.

::code-group
```ts [nitro.config.ts]
export default defineNitroConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/blog/**': { swr: true },
    '/blog/**': { swr: 600 },
    '/blog/**': { static: true },
    '/blog/**': { cache: { /* cache options*/ } },
    '/assets/**': { headers: { 'cache-control': 's-maxage=0' } },
    '/api/v1/**': { cors: true, headers: { 'access-control-allow-methods': 'GET' } },
    '/old-page': { redirect: '/new-page' },
    '/old-page/**': { redirect: '/new-page/**' },
    '/proxy/example': { proxy: 'https://example.com' },
    '/proxy/**': { proxy: '/api/**' },
  }
})
```
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/blog/**': { swr: true },
    '/blog/**': { swr: 600 },
    '/blog/**': { static: true },
    '/blog/**': { cache: { /* cache options*/ } },
    '/assets/**': { headers: { 'cache-control': 's-maxage=0' } },
    '/api/v1/**': { cors: true, headers: { 'access-control-allow-methods': 'GET' } },
    '/old-page': { redirect: '/new-page' },
    '/old-page/**': { redirect: '/new-page/**' },
    '/proxy/example': { proxy: 'https://example.com' },
    '/proxy/**': { proxy: '/api/**' },
  }
})
```
