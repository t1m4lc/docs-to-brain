# Migration Guide

> [!NOTE]
> This is a living document for migrating from Nitro 2 to 3. Please check it regularly while using the beta version.

Nitro v3 introduces intentional backward-incompatible changes. This guide helps you migrate from Nitro v2.

## `nitropack` is renamed to `nitro`

The NPM package [nitropack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nitropack) (v2) has been renamed to [nitro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nitro) (v3).

**Migration:** Update the `nitropack` dependency to `nitro` in `package.json`:

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only nightly releases are available.

```diff
{
  "dependencies": {
--    "nitropack": "latest"
++    "nitro": "npm:nitro-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```

**Migration:** Search your codebase and rename all instances of nitropack to nitro:

```diff
-- import { defineNitroConfig } from "nitropack/config"
++ import { defineNitroConfig } from "nitro/config"
```

## nitro/runtime/*

Previously, you could import from both `nitro/runtime` and `nitro/runtime/*`.

Support for nested paths has been removed to prevent exposing Nitro internals.

**Migration:** Search for nitro/runtime/ imports and replace them with nitro/runtime:

```diff
-- import { useStorage } from "nitropack/runtime/storage"
++ import { useStorage } from "nitro/runtime"
```

## Minimum Supported Node.js Version: 20

Nitro now requires a minimum Node.js version of 20, as Node.js 18 reaches end-of-life in [April 2025](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).

Please upgrade to the [latest LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version (>= 20).

**Migration:**

- Check your local Node.js version using `node --version` and update if necessary.
- If you use a CI/CD system for deployment, ensure that your pipeline is running Node.js 20 or higher.
- If your hosting provider manages the Node.js runtime, make sure itâ€™s set to version 20, 22, or later.

## Type Imports

Nitro types are now only exported from `nitro/types`.

**Migration:** Import types from nitro/types instead of nitro:

```diff
-- import { NitroRuntimeConfig } from "nitropack"
++ import { NitroRuntimeConfig } from "nitro/types"
```

## App Config Support Removed

Nitro v2 supported a bundled app config that allowed defining configurations in `app.config.ts` and accessing them at runtime via `useAppConfig()`.

This feature had been removed.

**Migration:**

Use a regular `.ts` file in your server directory and import it directly.

## Preset updates

Nitro presets have been updated for the latest compatibility.

Some (legacy) presets have been removed or renamed.

| Old Preset                   | New Preset                    |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `node`                       | `node-middleware` (export changed to `middleware`) |
| `cloudflare`, `cloudflare_worker`, `cloudflare_module_legacy` | `cloudflare_module`           |
| `deno-server-legacy`         | `deno_server` with Deno v2    |
| `netlify-builder`            | `netlify_functions` or `netlify_edge` |
| `vercel-edge`                | `vercel` with Fluid compute enabled |
| `azure`, `azure_functions`   | `azure_swa`                   |
| `firebase`                   | `firebase-functions`          |
| `iis`                        | `iis-handler`                 |
| `deno`                       | `deno-deploy`                 |
| `edgio`                      | `layer0`                      |
| `cli`                        | Removed due to lack of use |
| `service_worker`             | Removed due to instability |
| `firebase`                   | Use new firebase app hosting |

## Removed Subpath Exports

Nitro v2 introduced multiple subpath exports, some of which have been removed:

- `nitropack/core` (use `nitro`)
- `nitropack/runtime/*`
- `nitropack/dist/runtime/*`
- `nitropack/presets/*`
- `nitro/rollup`
- `nitropack/kit`

An experimental `nitropack/kit` was introduced but has now been removed. A standalone Nitro Kit package may be introduced in the future with clearer objectives.

**Migration:**

- Use `NitroModule` from `nitro/types` instead of `defineNitroModule` from the kit.
- Prefer built-in Nitro presets (external presets are only for evaluation purposes).
