title: serverSupabaseUser
description: Get your Supabase user from serverside with the serverSupabaseUser service
---

::warning
This section assumes you're familiar with [Nitro](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/server-engine), the server engine powered by Nuxt.
::

This function is similar to the [useSupabaseUser](/composables/usesupabaseuser) composable but is used in [server routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes).

Define your server route and import the `serverSupabaseUser` from `#supabase/server`.

```ts [server/api/me.ts]
import { serverSupabaseUser } from '#supabase/server'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  return await serverSupabaseUser(event)
})
```

Then call your api route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const user = ref(null)

const fetchMe = async () => {
   user.value = await $fetch('/api/me')
}
```

Be careful, if you want to call this route on SSR, please read this [section](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#isomorphic-fetch-and-fetch), you must send your browser cookies including your supabase token.

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const user = ref(null)

const { data } = await useFetch('/api/me', {
  headers: useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])
})

user.value = data
```
